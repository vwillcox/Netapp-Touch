# Netapp-Touch
Test your networks speed, connectivity, wifi and find what's connected. This project uses KIVY and KIVY KITCHEN code to create a
touch screen interface and QR Codes for quick information transfer to mobile devices.

In the initial version, it will test your internet speed using SPEEDTEST-CLI and provide the details on screen, along with a 
QR-CODE of the shareable results.

It also provides information about the Raspberry-Pi's network connection (Internal IP and External IP), with a QR-CODE to quick copy
the information to a mobile device.
